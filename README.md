# Octree for Point Cloud data
This repository contains an implementation of an Octree data structure in C++. The Octree is a tree-based data structure commonly used in computer graphics, computational geometry, and other applications that require spatial partitioning of three-dimensional data.

The purpose of this implementation is to provide an efficient solution for management of point cloud data in our project. The Octree allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of points within a volumetric region.
